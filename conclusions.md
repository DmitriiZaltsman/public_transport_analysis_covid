# Conclusion

In conclusion, this study provides insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of public transport in the EU. 
Our analysis indicates that there was a significant decrease in the number of trips made by public transport riders during the pandemic, 
primarily due to concerns about health risks. Interestingly, we found that the drop in the quality of public transport and a switch to remote work were not significant
factors in the decrease in trips. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that riders did not change their destinations, mode of transport, or avoid peak hours during the 
pandemic.

Despite concerns about health risks, the majority of the population in the EU remains comfortable with using public transport in the future, with only 
29 percent expressing wariness. Additionally, our analysis highlights that the accessibility of public transport in the EU is high, which is a positive finding
for policymakers and transportation authorities. However, it is worth noting that 30 percent of all respondents reported a decline in the overall quality of transport, 
which suggests that there is room for improvement in this area.

Overall, this study provides important insights into the impact of the pandemic on public transport ridership in the EU, and identifies areas where improvements
can be made to ensure the accessibility, convenience, and safety of public transport systems in the future.
