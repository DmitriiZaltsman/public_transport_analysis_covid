# public_transport_analysis_covid
The analysis of the survey conducted by Joint Research centre. This work examines the impact of COVID-19 on the transport system in the European Union, with a focus on public transport. 







# Ask
The main questions I asked was "Has the pandemic scared people who use public transport?" and "Has the pandemic changed the people's habits?"
In order to focus on the public transport the following route has been decided.

# Developing the stages

## Change in number of trips:
The task of this stage is to examine the change in the number of trips made by public transport goers after the COVID-19 pandemic started, and to identify any significant trends or patterns in the data. This will involve analyzing the survey responses related to the frequency of public transport use and comparing the results before and after the pandemic, with the aim of providing insights into the impact of COVID-19 on public transport ridership. Two groups of public transport users were put for this stage: the casual casual riders use public transport less than 2 days a week and frequent riders use the public transport more. Further stages will involve be analysing the frequent riders only.

## Change in other habits:
This involves analyzing the survey responses related to changes in destination choices, mode of transportation, and peak hour avoidance. The analysis will aim to identify any shifts in travel patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Reasoning behind the decrease in number of trips: 
The next stage of the analysis involves examining the factors that may be contributing to the decrease in the number of trips made by public transport goers. This will involve looking at the survey responses related to the reasons why people are using public transport less frequently. The analysis will aim to identify any common themes or patterns in the responses, such as concerns about the risk of exposure to COVID-19, changes in quality of public transport and switching to the remote form of work. By understanding the reasoning behind the decrease in public transport ridership, this stage of the analysis will provide valuable insights into the factors that are shaping the current transport landscape in the EU.

## Comfort, accessibility and feedback
The final stage of the analysis involves examining the survey responses related to the feedback on the public transportation system, specifically on the frequency of service, availability of seats due to rules and regulations, and the accessibility of the system. This includes analyzing the responses related to the satisfaction level of the population regarding the frequency of service and accessibility of public transport, as well as the availability of seats for passengers. Additionally, this stage involves examining the responses related to the availability of seats due to COVID-19 rules and regulations.
